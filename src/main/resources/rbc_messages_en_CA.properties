In the event that you do not have the required number of Points for your purchase, you must pay for the outstanding balance with a credit card. </li><li>The required number of Points and the corresponding basic price in dollars for an item are set out in the Best Buy and Future Shop catalogue(s). &nbsp;Applicable taxes and any other additional fees, if any, are not included in the required number of Points or corresponding basic price in dollars for the item, but they will clearly be disclosed to you prior to completing your transaction;</li><li>All merchandise appearing in the Best Buy and Future Shop catalogue(s) are subject to availability.&nbsp; Also, we reserve the right to limit the quantity of the same item you may want to order at once. &nbsp;If that is the case, and you wish to order more than the maximum quantity allowed, a separate order will need to be placed for each additional item;</li><li>When you order an item through this Program, Royal Bank relies on the information you provide when completing your order, including registration information (name and email address), which must be true, accurate, current and complete. You will be solely responsible and liable to Royal Bank for any and all loss, damage, and additional costs that you, Royal Bank or any other person may incur as a result of your submission of any false, incorrect or incomplete information.</li></ol><p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;Ship to Home&#8221; - Order Policy</span></strong></p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>For all items other than Scheduled Delivery Items, shipping is free.&nbsp; Additional shipping and handling charges apply to Scheduled Delivery Items and those additional charges will clearly be disclosed to you prior to completing your transaction.</li><li>If the item(s) you ordered is in stock, Royal Bank will email you a notice confirming that the item(s) has been shipped and is en-route to you. That notice is Royal Bank&#8217;s acceptance of your order.</li><li>If the item(s) you ordered is in-stock, we may be able to ship it to you on the same day, provided we receive your order by 3:00pm, Monday through Friday. &nbsp;However, during certain times of the year, such as &#8220;Boxing Week&#8221; when our warehouses are processing very large numbers of orders, we may not be able to ship your item(s) (or deliver it) the same day you placed your order. Shipment of your order may also be delayed due to external factors such as payment processing delays and weather conditions. Please note that same day shipping is not available for some products and services, including, but not limited to, out of stock items, Scheduled Delivery Items, items over 30kg, etc.</li><li>In-stock orders (excluding&nbsp;Scheduled Delivery Items) will normally get delivered within three (3) to seven (7) business days of placing your order. &nbsp;How soon you receive the item(s) depends on the shipping transit time.</li><li>For Scheduled Delivery Items, if your delivery is local, you&#8217;ll receive an email after your order has been processed notifying you of a suggested delivery date. If your delivery is remote, you&#8217;ll receive an email after your order has been processed notifying you that our home delivery carrier will be contacting you directly to schedule a delivery date.&nbsp; </li><li>Except for Scheduled Delivery Items, if you have not received your shipment within three (3) to seven (7) business days, please contact Royal Bank at 1-800-769-2512 and they will investigate the matter for you. &nbsp;If the investigation confirms the item(s) was delivered to you, then you will not be eligible to receive any refund for the item(s).</li><li>You can also request delivery updates for Canada Post orders, by following the steps below. You&#8217;ll be able to set up similar notifications via the websites of other carriers as well:<ol><li>Locate your tracking number;</li><li>Visit Canada Post&#8217;s &#8220;Track a Package&#8221; page&nbsp;and enter your tracking number;</li><li>Select "Request Delivery Updates by email"; and</li><li>Complete the request form and press &#8220;submit&#8221;.</li></ol></li><li>If the tracking information indicates that your item(s) is being returned to us or has become undeliverable, please&nbsp; contact Royal Bank at 1-800-769-2512 &nbsp;so one of our agents can assist in starting an investigation on your behalf.</li><li>If shipping information such as the apartment number or street address was entered incorrectly when placing your order, your order may be returned to us without any delivery attempts being made. To avoid any additional delays, we suggest tracking your package regularly, or requesting delivery updates from the carrier through their website.</li><li>Canada Post will not leave a package on your doorstep if you are not home to receive it. Instead, the carrier will leave you a note with an address to the closest postal outlet where you can pick up your package by showing a valid piece of government ID.&nbsp;</li><li>When certain items that weigh 30Kg or more are delivered by a third party carrier (like Purolator or UPS etc.), delivery personnel may not bring the item all the way into your residence if the item is considered a potential health and safety risk or if there is no one available to assist the carrier. In certain cases, especially when delivery access may be obstructed or otherwise potentially dangerous, items may be left at the door or taken to a shipping depot for pick up after a delivery attempt is made.</li></ol><p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;Reserve and Pick Up&#8221; - Order Policy</span></strong></p><ol><li>The merchandise section of the catalogue(s) allows you to search for all items in the catalogue(s), as well as identify items that are available for the Reserve and Pick Up option.</li><li>If a Reserve and Pick Up option is available, it means that you can pick up the item in-store.&nbsp; If a Reserve and Pick Up option is not available, that item must be shipped to you from a distribution center and cannot be picked up in-store. </li><li>Once the order is placed through the Reserve and Pick Up option, it cannot be changed to a &#8220;Ship to Home&#8221; order.</li><li>The Reserve and Pick Up store availability is based upon the postal code or the city and province you supply when you complete your order.&nbsp; Store availability will be based upon the item(s) selected and the stores within an<strong> </strong>80 KM radius of the location supplied.&nbsp; A maximum of six (6) stores with availability will be displayed.</li><li>Once you are ready to proceed to checkout, you will be asked to pay for your order in totality, including for all applicable taxes and any additional fees, if any, using Points or a combination of Points and a credit card.</li><li>Once you have completed the checkout process, an order confirmation email will be sent to the email address you have specified on the order.&nbsp; This does not mean the item(s) is ready for pick up, as it is only a confirmation that the order has been received.</li><li>If we discover there is an issue with inventory or your method of payment, another follow-up email will be sent notifying you of the reason why we cannot process your order.</li><li>Once the order is ready for pick up, another email will be sent to the email address specified on the order, which will notify you that the order is ready for pick up at the selected store (<em>during regular business hours)</em>.&nbsp; An e-Gift card for the total amount you paid in accordance with paragraph (e) above will also be included in that email.&nbsp; The item(s) ordered through the Reserve and Pick Up option will be listed on that email. You must present the e-Gift card when you pick up your item(s) at the store; you can either bring a paper copy of the e-Gift card or you can decide to show it to us via your mobile device. </li><li>Even if you are ordering an item for someone else, only the person identified on the order may pick up the order.&nbsp;This person must present the e-Gift card at time of pick up. The e-Gift Card will contain the order number needed to identify your individual order.&nbsp; This person will also need a government issued photo ID that matches the name as supplied on the order and listed on the e-Gift card email.&nbsp; If you or this person does not have this information, the order cannot be picked up from the store.</li><li>Typically, the item(s) are ready for pick up from the selected store within one (1) hour of the order being placed (during regular business hours) through the catalogue system and receipt of the order confirmation email.&nbsp; However, some items may take longer to process at the selected store.</li><li>Once inside the selected store, proceed to the area identified by the Reserve and Pick Up sign.&nbsp; You or the person picking up the order may also ask a store associate where to pick up the item(s).</li><li>The item(s) that you reserved will be available for pick up at the selected store for 24 hours after receiving the e-Gift card email notification.&nbsp; If the order is not picked up within this period, the item(s) is no longer reserved.&nbsp; However, if the item(s) is still in the store after this period, you can still redeem the e-Gift card for the item(s).&nbsp; Likewise, you can decide to redeem your e-Gift card for any other item(s) in the store or keep it and use it for future purchases since your e-Gift card does not expire and retains the full value of the purchase price of the original item(s) you ordered.</li><li>You or the person picking up the order will also be given a store receipt (invoice) for this order.&nbsp; You must keep this store receipt in the event you need to return/exchange an item to the store.&nbsp; Returns/exchanges will not be processed without this receipt.</li></ol><p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;Return and Exchange Policy</span></strong></p><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Rules</span></strong></p><p style="padding-left: 60px;">(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all returns and exchanges, you will need the following:</p><p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>1. &nbsp;If you picked up your item(s) in store, the original receipt (invoice)</strong><strong> that we gave you at the time you picked up your item(s) in-store; or</strong><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p><p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>2. &nbsp;If your item(s) were delivered to you, the &#8220;Purchase Order Number&#8221;</strong> that was indicated on the confirmation email that was sent to you after you placed your order; and&nbsp;</p><p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>3. &nbsp;Original packaging and all       items</strong>.&nbsp;       For complete details, please read Sub-Sections (ii) and (iii)       below.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></p><p style="padding-left: 60px;">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All item(s) (both defective and non-defective) must be returned in their original purchase condition and with everything that formed part of the original packaging including blank warranty cards, manuals and any other item or accessory provided by the manufacturer.
