terms-content-StorePolicies=<h3>Sales Terms and Conditions</h3> \
    <div class="term-cell"> \
        <h4>Consumers Only</h4> \
        <p>The MileagePlus Apple Store sells and ships products to end-user customers only, and we reserve the right to \
            refuse or cancel your order if we suspect you are purchasing products for resale.</p></div> \
    <div class="term-cell"> \
        <h4>U.S. Sales Only</h4> \
        <p>The MileagePlus Apple Store accepts orders from billing addresses within the United States only. \
            We will not ship products purchased at the MileagePlus Apple Store to an address outside of the \
            United States. Apple products are subject to U.S. and foreign export control laws and regulations \
            and must be purchased, sold, exported, re-exported, transferred, and used in compliance with such export \
            laws and regulations.</p></div> \
    <div class="term-cell"> \
        <h4>Product Availability and Limitations</h4> \
        <p>Given the popularity and/or supply constraints of some products, the number of products available \
           for purchase may be limited. We reserve the right to change quantities available for purchase at any \
           time, even after you place an order. Furthermore, there may be occasions when we confirm your order but \
           subsequently learn that we cannot supply the ordered product. In the event we cannot supply a product you \
           ordered, we will cancel the order and provide a full refund.</p></div> \
    <div class="term-cell"> \
        <h4>Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections</h4> \
        <p>We reserve the right to change prices for products displayed at/on the MileagePlus Apple Store at any \
           time, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur.</p></div> \
    <div class="term-cell"> \
        <h4>Order Acceptance/Confirmation</h4> \
        <p>The MileagePlus Apple Store may, in its sole discretion, refuse or cancel any order and limit order \
           quantity. We may also require additional qualifying information prior to accepting or processing any order. \
           Once we receive your order, we'll provide you with an email order confirmation. Your receipt of an order \
           confirmation, however, does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation \
           of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. The MileagePlus Apple Store \
           reserves the right at any time after receiving your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. \
           If we cancel an order, we will provide a refund for that order.</p></div> \
    <div class="term-cell"> \
        <h4>Tax rate</h4> \
        <p>In accordance with local law, your MileagePlus Apple Store redemptions will be taxed using the applicable \
           tax rate(s) for your shipping address. If you change your shipping address during checkout, the price of \
           your order may change to reflect taxes and fees for that address.</p></div> \
    <div class="term-cell"> \
        <h4>Additional Apple Product Terms</h4> \
        <p>The purchase and use of Apple products are subject to additional Apple terms and conditions \

        <p>Eligibility to pay using miles earned in connection with the United MileagePlus loyalty program \
           (the "MileagePlus Program") is at the discretion of United, may vary by member and may change at any time \
           without notice. In United's discretion, Apple product awards may be paid for using MileagePlus miles or a \
           combination of miles and money. Any money portion must be paid using a credit card or debit card or as \
           otherwise indicated on the website. Not all members will be eligible to pay with a combination of miles and \
           money. The amount of miles or miles and money necessary for a transaction will be set by United, are subject \
           to change and may vary by member. Certain MileagePlus members may receive preferential pricing. Pricing is \
           subject to change without notice. You must have sufficient miles in your MileagePlus account to complete the \
           transaction.  You may not combine miles from two or more accounts on a single transaction.  Your miles will \
           be deducted at the time of purchase.  In the event that miles have not been properly debited from your \
           account at the time of redemption, such miles may be debited by United at any time.  Refunds, when \
           available, will be made in the original form of payment less any fees and charges, where applicable.  No \
           MileagePlus award miles will be awarded in connection with transactions made using MileagePlus miles as a \
           form of payment.</p> \
        <p>If applicable, any fees or redemption-associated charges (including without limitation the money portion of \
           any miles and money transaction) will appear on your credit card statements as "United Apple Product". </p> \
        <p>In its sole discretion, at any time, and for any or no reason, United may prevent or restrict access to this \
           redemption opportunity or any part thereof for all or certain MileagePlus members, with or without notice. \
           Access may vary by member. Any actual or suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity is grounds for \
           termination of your access to this redemption opportunity in United's sole discretion and may be referred \
           to appropriate law enforcement authorities. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies United may \
           have pursuant to the MileagePlus Program Rules or at law or in equity.</p> \
        <p>Miles or other credits acquired from any loyalty program other than MileagePlus may not be used in \
           connection with this redemption opportunity. Credit earned in any loyalty, recognition, or rewards program \
           other than MileagePlus is at the discretion of such other program.</p> \
        <p>Miles accrued, awards, and benefits issued are subject to change and are subject to the rules of the \
           MileagePlus Program, including without limitation the Premier\u00AE program, which are expressly incorporated \
           herein.  United may change the MileagePlus Program including, but not limited to, rules, regulations, \

        <p>Some of our shipments require a signature. If you will not be available to sign for your shipment, consider \
           shipping the item to an address where someone you trust will be available to sign for your package. Once \
           your order has prepared for shipment or has shipped, we are unable to change the shipping address.</p></div> \
    <h3>Track Shipments</h3> \
    <div class="term-cell"> \
        <p>As soon as your item(s) have shipped, we'll send you a Shipment Notification email that includes your \
        carrier and, if available, a carrier tracking number. If you ordered multiple items, you may have separate \
        tracking information for each item.</p></div> \
    <h3>Shipping Restrictions</h3> \
     <div class="term-cell"> \
        <p>MileagePlus Apple Store ships items within the continental US, Alaska, and Hawaii. No shipments can be \
            made to PO Box addresses, United States territories, or addresses outside of the United States. You may \
            not export any products purchased at the Apple Loyalty Store.</p></div> \
    <h3>Incorrect or damaged items</h3> \
      <div class="term-cell"> \
        <p>If you received the wrong product or it was damaged during shipping, please call MileagePlus Apple \
            Store Customer Service at <span class="terms-service-number">1-844-344-6347</span>.</p></div>
terms-content-iPhone=<div class="term-cell"> \
          <p>Find out about iPhone availability, how to purchase iPhone, activation, support, training, and more.</p></div> \
    <h3>Availability</h3> \
    <div class="term-cell"> \
        <p>When you purchase your iPhone from the MileagePlus Apple Store, you will get it SIM-free, which means it is \
           not provisioned to any specific wireless carrier. You can sign up for service with the carrier of your \
           choice and change your carrier at any time.</p></div> \
    <h3>How do I activate my iPhone?</h3> \
    <div class="term-cell"> \
        <p>If you are ready to activate your iPhone, call the wireless carrier of your choice and inform them you have \
           an unlocked iPhone and want to activate it for service. Apple does not provide any wireless service and is \
           not involved in the activation of your iPhone, but by purchasing your iPhone on our site you have the option \
           of wireless carriers.</p></div> \
    <h3>Support and Training</h3> \
    <div class="term-cell"> \
        <p>Apple has designed iPhone to be incredibly simple to use. Nevertheless, there may be times that you \
           could use a little help.</p></div> \
    <div class="term-cell"> \
        <h4>iPhone support</h4> \
        <p>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/iphone" target="_blank">iPhone Support</a> site contains a wealth \
            of information to help you learn more about iPhone capabilities, including the iPhone User Guide, \
            technical support articles, troubleshooting tips, and customer discussion forums.</p> \
        <p>iPhone comes with 90 days of technical support. In addition, your iPhone, its rechargeable battery, and all \
           included accessories are covered against defects for a full year from the purchase date by a limited hardware warranty. \
           Learn more about your <a href="http://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/" target="_blank">Hardware Warranty</a>.</p> \
        <p>For hardware or software support, please visit Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/iphone" target="_blank">online resources</a>, \
           or visit an Apple Retail Store, or call 1-800-MY-IPHONE (<a class="tele-no" href="tel:18006947466">1-800-694-7466</a>).</p></div> \
    <h3>Warranty</h3> \
    <div class="term-cell"> \
        <p>Making unauthorized modifications to the software on an iPhone violates the iPhone software license \
           agreement. The common term for modifying an iPhone is jail-breaking, with a particular emphasis on the \
           second part of that term. That's why we strongly, almost emphatically, recommend that you do not do so. \
           Really. Should you be unable to use your iPhone due to an unauthorized software modification, its repair \
           will not be covered under the warranty.</p></div> \
    <h3>Additional Information</h3> \
    <div class="term-cell"> \
        <h4>Accessory compatibility</h4> \
        <p>While there are thousands of accessories that have been designed specifically for iPod, not all of these are fully compatible with iPhone. This is because cell phones can cause audio interference with some accessories.</p> \
        <p>To ensure the best possible customer experience, Apple has created special iPhone compatibility requirements for accessory manufacturers. Products that are engineered and certified to be compatible with iPhone carry a "Works with iPhone" logo on the packaging.</p> \
        <p>If you connect iPhone to an accessory that was not made to work with iPhone, you can activate Airplane Mode while connected to the accessory. This will avoid any potential audio interference, but you will not be able to make or receive calls. If you choose not to activate Airplane Mode, you will still be able to make and receive calls, but you may experience some audio interference.</p> \
        <p>To shop for iPhone gear, explore the Accessories section of the MileagePlus Apple Store.</p></div>
